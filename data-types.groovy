// bitwise operators
// ^ means exclusive  "or" ===> if both sides of the equation are not the same , it is true
// ~ means negation

//example for bitwise operators
int l = 20 // binary of 20 is : 10100
int h = 25 // the binary of 25 is : 11001
println(l & h) // the result will be 16 because the adding happened after converting the numbers to the  binary form first

/*
   10100
     &&
   11001
= ---------
   10000  this is equal to 16
